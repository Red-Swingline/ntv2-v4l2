OVERVIEW

	This directory contains the AJA NTV2 V4L2/ALSA driver.

VERSION

	1.0.0		initial release

REQUIREMENTS

	Builds in 3.10.0 <= linux (64 bit) <= 4.3.0 (approximately)

	AJA Video IO board support:
		Kona4
		Corvid44
		Corvid88
		CorvidHDBT

BUILDING THE DRIVER

	A simple 'make' will build the driver.  If there are build errors
	they may be due to v4l2 interface changes.  To manage this there
	are several kernel version #ifdef(s) in ntv2_common.h.  The kernel
	versions are approximate; you may need to adjust them for your kernel.

LOADING THE DRIVER

	To load the driver use:	'sudo ./load'.  The script modprobe(s) several
	dependencies before loading the ntv2video.ko driver.  There is also an
	unload script.  Unloading the driver requires exiting any application
	that has opened the driver including the system audio mixer (pulseaudio).
